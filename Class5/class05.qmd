Today we are exploring the **gggplot** package and how to make nice figures in R

There are lots of ways to make figures and plot in R. These include:

- so called "base" R
- and add on packages like **ggplot2**

Here is a simple "base" R plot.

```{r}
head(cars)
```

We can simply pass this to the 'plot()' function.
```{r}
plot(cars)
```

> key-point: Base R is quick but not so nice and simple looking in some folks eyes.
